1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to detail the functional and non-functional requirements for the AI-Powered Automated Progress Payment Verification System. This platform aims to modernize and streamline the process of progress payments within the construction industry by integrating secure digital payment functionalities with advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) for objective progress verification. This document serves as a comprehensive guide for development, testing, and project management, ensuring all stakeholders have a clear and shared understanding of the system's capabilities and constraints.

1.2 Scope
The scope of this project encompasses the design, development, testing, and deployment of a web-based digital payment platform. Key functionalities include:

User authentication and authorization.

Secure payment processing via a third-party gateway (Paystack).

Comprehensive payment and transaction history tracking.

AI-driven progress verification using computer vision on construction site imagery.

Integration of AI-verified progress with payment eligibility.

A user-friendly interface for managing payments and viewing progress.

The system will initially focus on the core functionalities required for automated payment verification and processing, with provisions for future enhancements such as advanced analytics and deeper integration with construction management tools.

1.3 Target Audience
This SRS is intended for:

Development Team: Frontend (React) and Backend (Django) developers responsible for implementing the system.

AI/ML Engineers: Responsible for developing, training, and integrating the computer vision models.

Payment Initialization: Users (e.g., contractors) can initiate payment requests with specified amounts and methods.

AI-Driven Progress Verification:

Uploading construction site images/videos.

Automated analysis of visual data to detect and identify specific construction elements (e.g., erected columns, poured slabs, installed walls).

Quantification of completed work and calculation of a verified progress percentage.

Payment Verification & Triggering:

Comparison of AI-verified progress against predefined project milestones.

Automated flagging of discrepancies between claimed and verified progress.

Conditional triggering of payment processing based on verified progress meeting milestone requirements.

Payment Processing: Integration with Paystack API for secure handling of financial transactions (initialization and verification).

Payment & Transaction History: Comprehensive tracking and display of all payment requests, their statuses, and associated individual transactions.

Reporting & Analytics: Basic reporting on payment statuses and project progress trends.

Admin Management: A backend interface for administrators to manage users, payments, transactions, and review AI analysis results.

2.2 User Characteristics
The system is designed for various users within the construction ecosystem:

Contractors/Subcontractors: Users who initiate payment requests and upload progress images. They require a simple interface for submitting requests and viewing their payment status.

Project Managers/Quantity Surveyors: Users responsible for verifying progress and approving payments. They need access to detailed progress verification data, discrepancy flags, and approval workflows.

Administrators: Users with full control over the platform, managing users, reviewing all payments and transactions, and potentially overseeing AI model performance.

Developers: Those integrating with the API (e.g., frontend developers, future third-party integrators) require clear API documentation.

2.3 General Constraints
Platform: Web-based application.

Technology Stack: React (Frontend), Django (Backend API), PostgreSQL (Database), Paystack API (Payment Gateway).

AI Framework: Python-based Deep Learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow/PyTorch) for Computer Vision.

Payment Gateway: Initial integration limited to Paystack for Nigerian market focus.

Security: Adherence to industry best practices for data security and privacy.

Scalability: Designed to handle increasing user loads and data volumes.

2.4 Assumptions and Dependencies
Internet Connectivity: Users require a stable internet connection to access the platform and for API interactions.

Paystack Account: A valid Paystack merchant account (test for development, live for production) is available with necessary API keys.

Image Quality: AI verification accuracy depends on the quality and clarity of uploaded construction images/videos.

AI Model Training Data: Sufficient and diverse annotated datasets are available or can be generated for training the AI models.

External APIs: Reliance on the availability and stability of Paystack API.

User Email: Paystack requires an email for transaction initialization, so user accounts should ideally have a valid email.
